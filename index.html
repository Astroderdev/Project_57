                Hobbies are a great way to relax and unwind.
                 These are done after a stressful day at school, college, or office.
                  There is no rule of what can be termed as a hobby. It could be anything, 
                  from stamp collection to painting, or even travelling.
                 Anything can be considered as a hobby if it relaxes your mind.
            </p>
            <p>My favorite hobby is Programming. I do a lot of work in it. I have a destiny to become a Rocket Programer/Aerospace Enginnering. So i kept my Hobby
                as this. It relaxes my stressful mind after studying from school. From that i have made a bot called Hierol. It is an AI.
                I have also made a server which he manages all settings of my server. And also i am working on my personal website, Amreshweb.
                Other than that i have also a hobby of reading. I read Encyclopedia of space in order to be my destiny.The programming teaches us Discipline, Concentration on 
                a particular thing.
                So this is my hobby of my life. THANK YOU üëçüëç.
